  <p>
    JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[6]), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level dynamic weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language.<br>
    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production.<br>
    It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online programs, including video games.<br>
    The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engine.<br>
    Each of the many JavaScript engines represent a different implementation of JavaScript, all based on the ECMAScript specification, with some engines not supporting the spec fully, and with many engines supportiong additional features beyond ECMA.
